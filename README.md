# Acoustic Characterization of Uniform Linear Arrays
Report and presentation concerning the acoustic characterization of a novel microphone array system carried out in the context of the "Music and Acoustic Engineering Capstone" course of the Master's Degree in Music and Acoustic Engineering at Politecnico di Milano in collaboration with the Image and Sound Processing Laboratory.

## Brief Description and Context of the Project
Microphone arrays are effective tools for capturing Room Impulse Responses, 
providing valuable insights of the acoustic characteristics of a room. Various types of arrays, 
including uniform linear microphone arrays (ULAs), can be exploited for this purpose. The 
Image and Sound Processing Lab (ISPL) has recently acquired four new ESticks V3 to its 
equipment, which are Dante powered ULAs developed by Eventide in collaboration with 
Politecnico di Milano. The first goal of this project is to enhance already existing position 
calibration methods, used to estimate the location of devices, to include constraint on the 
geometry of the ESticks. A second objective is to evaluate the acoustic performance of these 
new models and assess the suitability of the acquired signals for different applications, such 
as reverberation time estimation. The evaluation will be conducted through actual 
measurement sessions at the ISPL facilities in Cremona.
